# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and resources for a laptop price predictor using a Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features and specifications. The Random Forest Regressor is employed for its ability to handle non-linearity and capture complex relationships in the data.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version x.x)
- [List other dependencies or libraries]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-predictor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd laptop-price-predictor
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the laptop price predictor, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a Streamlit server, and you can access the application by navigating to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your web browser.

## Features

- Predicts laptop prices based on various features and specifications.
